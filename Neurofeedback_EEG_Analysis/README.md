# 🧠 Neurofeedback EEG Analysis – Curling Athletes

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between brainwave activity and athletic performance using EEG data from elite curling athletes. The goal is to inform the design of a neurofeedback training program that targets brain regions and frequency bands associated with improved focus, precision, and shot accuracy.

## 🎯 Objective

To identify brainwave patterns (theta, alpha, beta) that correlate with better performance and recommend areas for neurofeedback intervention.

## 📊 Tools Used

- **Excel** – Data transformation, calculations, regression plots
- **Word** – Final report preparation
- **Data Source** – EMOTIV EEG data from 7 curling athletes across 10 shots each

## 📈 Methods

1. Created new variables for:
   - Frontal lobe and hemisphere averages (theta, alpha, beta)
   - Total brain averages by frequency band
2. Built scatterplots of shot accuracy vs. EEG metrics
3. Applied linear regression, R², and line-of-best-fit to each plot
4. Interpreted trends to suggest training targets

## 💡 Key Findings

- **Left Frontal Theta**: High theta linked to poor shot accuracy → reduce in training  
- **Left Hemisphere Alpha**: Moderate levels improve relaxed focus → stabilize  
- **Left Frontal Beta**: Balanced beta supports motor control → maintain moderate  
- **Right Hemisphere Beta**: Excessive beta linked to overload → avoid high stimulation  

## 🧪 Recommendations

Neurofeedback training should:
- Decrease theta in the left frontal lobe
- Stabilize alpha in the left hemisphere
- Maintain moderate beta in left, avoid excess in right

🟡 **Note**: This project was originally completed as an academic assignment during my Health Analytics program at Cambrian College. While it reflects early-stage learning, it laid the foundation for my understanding of EEG analysis, data-driven recommendations, and dashboard storytelling. Future projects in this portfolio build on the feedback and lessons from this one.
